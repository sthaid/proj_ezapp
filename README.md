ezApp
=====

EzApp is intended to run on Android
Smartphones.

EzApp runs miniApps and miniSvcs that
are written in the C Language. These
miniApps and miniSvcs are executed by
a C language interpreter.

Users can develop their own miniApps
and miniSvcs. To develop miniApps and
miniSvcs a PC is required.

When ezApp is first run on your Android
device, the following permissions will
be requested:

- Post Notifications
- Access Coarse Location
- Access Fine Location
- Activity Recognition
- Record Audio

If some of these permissions are not
granted then some ezApp capabilities
will not function. For example, if
'Activity Recognition' is not granted
the Step counter will not function.

Source code is here:
https://github.com/sthaid/ezApp.git.
See the doc directory for details.
